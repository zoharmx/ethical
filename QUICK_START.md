Subject: Ethical AI Review for [Company Name]

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is building AI-powered [product]. 

Before launch, have you considered:
- Algorithm bias risks?
- Privacy compliance (GDPR)?
- Potential PR issues?

I've developed an ethical analysis framework that 
systematically reviews AI deployments. Recent case:

→ Client wanted to launch AI hiring tool
→ Our analysis flagged gender bias risk
→ Fixed BEFORE deployment
→ Saved $millions in potential lawsuits

Would you like a free analysis of [their product]?

30-minute call, no commitment.

### Template 2: LinkedIn DM (Corporates)

Hi [Name],

Saw your post about [Company]'s new AI initiative.

Quick question: How are you handling ethical review 
before deployment?

I ask because I've built an enterprise framework that:
- Analyzes AI systems across 10 dimensions
- Detects bias automatically (multi-provider AI)
- Provides quantitative risk scores
- EU AI Act compliant

Currently working with [name-drop if you have any].
