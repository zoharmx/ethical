However, it carries significant environmental risks, including potential toxicity to aquatic organisms, alteration of weather patterns (rain theft), and unpredictable rainfall. Socially, it could lead to regional conflicts and disproportionately benefits a wealthy urban area while potentially harming rural communities and neighboring states. The effectiveness is debated, and the proposal raises ethical concerns about prioritizing elite interests over the common good and long-term environmental sustainability."
