However, it carries significant environmental risks, including potential toxicity to aquatic organisms, alteration of weather patterns (rain theft), and unpredictable rainfall. Socially, it could exacerbate regional conflicts and inequalities, benefiting a wealthy urban area at the expense of rural communities and neighboring states. The effectiveness of cloud seeding is debated, and the proposal prioritizes a short-term benefit for an elite event over long-term solutions to water scarcity and climate change. There is a lack of transparency and consultation with affected communities."
