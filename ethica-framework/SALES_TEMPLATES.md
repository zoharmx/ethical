### 1. COLD EMAIL - STARTUPS DE IA

**Subject:** [Company Name] - Ethical review before launch?

```
Hi [First Name],

Saw that [Company] just raised [amount] for [AI product]. Congrats!

Quick question: Have you done ethical review of [specific feature]
before launch?

I ask because we recently analyzed a similar AI hiring tool and found
gender bias that would've caused a PR disaster + potential $5M lawsuit.

We caught it 2 weeks before their launch. They fixed it. Crisis avoided.

Would you want a free ethical analysis of [their AI feature]?

Takes 48 hours, identifies:
- Algorithmic bias risks
- Privacy/GDPR issues
- Regulatory red flags
- PR nightmare scenarios

No cost for the first analysis. If it's valuable, we can discuss ongoing
audits ($3,500/analysis).

15-min call this week to discuss?

Best,
[Your Name]
Founder, Ethica.AI
P.S. Recent case study: [link to Nuevo León FIFA analysis]

Subject: Re: [Company Name] - Ethical review before launch?

Hi [First Name],

Following up on my email from Monday about ethical review.

I get it - you're busy scaling. But here's the thing:

One of our clients almost launched an AI system that discriminated
against certain demographics. They didn't see it. We did.

Cost to fix BEFORE launch: $20K
Cost to fix AFTER lawsuit: $5M+

Is 15 minutes to prevent a $5M problem worth it?

Let me know,
[Your Name]
```

### 5. PARTNERSHIP PITCH - CONSULTORÍAS

**Subject:** Partnership opportunity - Ethica.AI + [Consultancy Name]

```
Hi [Decision Maker],

I run Ethica.AI - an AI ethics analysis platform used by [clients].

I'm reaching out because I think there's a strong partnership
opportunity between our companies.

**The Opportunity:**

Your clients are asking about AI ethics and EU AI Act compliance.
You could:
1. Hire ethics team (expensive, slow to build)
2. Partner with us (immediate capability)

**Revenue Share Model:**

- You sell "AI Ethics Audit" as add-on to existing engagements
- You charge clients $25K - $50K
- We deliver analysis + reports (white-labeled under your brand)
- We split revenue 70/30 (you/us)

**Example:**

Client: Bank implementing AI credit scoring
Your engagement: AI strategy ($200K)
Add-on: Ethical audit ($35K)
Your total revenue: $235K
Our cut: $10.5K (30% of $35K)
Your extra profit: $24.5K (zero extra work)

**Case Study:**

We recently analyzed government cloud seeding proposal (attached).
This is the kind of analysis your clients want for AI projects.

## 📞 CALL SCRIPTS

### Discovery Call Script (15 minutes)

**Objective:** Qualify lead + Book paid analysis

---

**PHASE 1: Intro (1 min)**

```
"Hi [Name], thanks for taking the time! I saw [specific detail about
their company/AI project]. Excited to learn more about it.

Before we dive in, what's the best use of the next 15 minutes for you?"
```

---

**PHASE 2: Discovery Questions (5 min)**

```
1. "Tell me about the AI system you're building. What's the core function?"

2. "Who are the main users/stakeholders?"

3. "Have you done any ethical review or bias testing yet?"
   [If YES] "What did you find?"
   [If NO] "What's held you back - time, expertise, or not sure where to start?"

4. "What's your biggest concern: algorithmic bias, privacy issues,
   regulatory compliance, or PR risk?"

5. "When are you planning to launch/deploy?"

6. [If enterprise] "Are you operating in EU or planning to? The AI Act
   requires risk assessments for certain systems..."
```

**Key things to listen for:**
- ❌ Red flags (not decision maker, no budget, not launching soon)
- ✅ Green flags (has budget, launching soon, worried about specific risk)

---

**PHASE 3: Solution Positioning (4 min)**

```
"Got it. So here's how we'd help with [their specific concern]:

Our framework analyzes your system through 10 ethical dimensions:
- [Mention 2-3 most relevant to their concern]

Example: [Quick relevant case study]
- Client: [Similar company]
- Challenge: [Similar to theirs]
- What we found: [Specific risk]
- Outcome: [How we helped]

The process:
1. You describe your system (30-min interview + documentation)
2. We analyze (48 hours)
3. You get comprehensive report (PDF + JSON + roadmap)

Cost: $3,500 for first analysis
Timeline: 48-72 hours from kickoff

vs. Traditional consultancy: $50K, 6 weeks

Does this sound like it would solve [their concern]?"
```

---

**PHASE 4: Objection Handling (3 min)**

**Common objections:**

**"That's expensive"**
```
"I hear you. Let's put it in context:
- One discrimination lawsuit: $5M average settlement
- One PR crisis: Stock drop 10-20%
- EU AI Act fine: Up to 6% of global revenue

$3,500 is insurance. And if we don't find anything valuable,
full refund within 7 days."
```

**"We can do this internally"**
```
"You absolutely could. Quick question: Do you have expertise in:
- Algorithmic fairness across demographics?
- GDPR/EU AI Act compliance?
- Multi-cultural ethical frameworks?

Most companies don't. That's why Amazon, Google, Meta all had
bias incidents - smart people, but blind spots.

External review catches what internal teams miss."
```

**"Not ready yet / will do later"**
```
"I totally get it. When's your target launch date?

The challenge is, fixing issues found AFTER launch is 10x harder:
- Code is in production
- Users affected
- Legal exposure already happened

Best practice: Audit in beta, fix before launch. Takes 48h now,
saves months of crisis management later.

How about this: Let's do preliminary analysis now while you're
still building. That way you know what to watch for."
```

**"Let me think about it"**
```
"Of course! What questions do you still have?

[Address questions]

Tell you what: I'll send you:
1. Sample report (Nuevo León case study)
2. Pricing breakdown
3. 3 references from similar companies

Review over next few days, then let's reconnect Friday.
Sound good?"
```

---

**PHASE 5: Close (2 min)**

**If they're ready to buy:**
```
"Awesome! Here's next steps:
1. I'll send contract + invoice today via email
2. You sign + pay via Stripe ($3,500)
3. We schedule 30-min intake call (I'll send Calendly link)
4. 48 hours later, you get comprehensive report
5. 30-min debrief call to discuss findings

First available intake slot is [day/time]. Work for you?"
```

**If they need to think:**
```
"No pressure! Let me send you:
- Case study PDF
- Sample report
- Pricing sheet
- References

Let's reconnect [specific day] at [time]. I'll send calendar invite.

Any other questions before we wrap?"
```

**Always end with:**
```
"Thanks for your time, [Name]. Looking forward to helping [Company]
launch ethically. I'll send those materials in the next hour."
```

- 5 analyses per month as you iterate
- Catch issues early as features evolve

**Option 2: Implementation Support ($8,000)**
- We help implement the mitigation recommendations
- 4 weeks of consulting + code review

**Option 3: One-off analyses as needed**
- $3,500 each (you know the drill)

What sounds most useful for [Company]'s roadmap?

Best,
[Your Name]
