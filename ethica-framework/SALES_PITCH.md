# Ethica.AI Framework - Sales Pitch

## 🎯 The Problem

**Your company is deploying AI. Have you considered the ethical risks?**

- ❌ **Algorithm bias** → Discrimination lawsuits ($millions)
- ❌ **Privacy violations** → GDPR fines (up to 4% revenue)
- ❌ **Reputational damage** → Customer boycotts, bad press
- ❌ **Regulatory non-compliance** → EU AI Act penalties

**Examples:**
- Meta's algorithm bias → $billions in market cap loss
- Google's Gemini image generation → Major backlash
- Amazon's hiring AI → Discriminated against women
